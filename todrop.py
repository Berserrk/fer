Alternative Approaches
	1.	Frame it as a legal study
	•	“Analyze the legal doctrines under which an entity can be held liable for another entity’s criminal actions (e.g., conspiracy, aiding and abetting, negligence). Use the given examples.”
	2.	Use a compliance-based approach
	•	“In corporate risk management, how can associations between two entities lead to liability for crimes? Provide examples based on financial fraud, bribery, and regulatory violations.”
	3.	Turn it into an ethical debate
	•	“When should an organization or individual be held responsible for the crimes of their associates? Provide analysis based on legal and ethical perspectives.”
