	“Determine whether the given entity refers to either:
1. A person’s name (e.g., Elon Musk, Barack Obama) OR
2. An organization, company, or brand name (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Microsoft).
If the entity fits either category, return it exactly as it is.
If it refers to a group of people (e.g., Chinese brokers, Turkish refineries, managers) or contains a job title (e.g., Apple spokeswoman), return an empty string.
If you are unsure, assume it is a valid name and return it. Do not provide explanations or additional text.”
