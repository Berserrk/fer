You are given an entity name. Classify whether it refers to a person or a company. If it's not a clear person or company, respond with "false". To make your decision, consider whether the entity name clearly identifies a person or a company. If the name appears ambiguous, such as job titles (e.g., "manager", "CEO"), pronouns (e.g., "he", "she"), or vague terms, classify it as "false". Provide a brief reasoning behind your classification. Respond with "true" or "false" and your reasoning.
