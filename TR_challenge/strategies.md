STRATEGIES 
1. Hierarchical Chunking & Encoding
Split each document into 512-token section chunks, run them through a base transformer (e.g. BERT), then aggregate chunk embeddings via a lightweight Transformer or RNN to form a document vector  ￼.

2. Domain-Adapted Transformer Fine-Tuning
Start from a LegalBERT checkpoint pre-trained on court opinions, add a sigmoid-activated multi-label head, and fine-tune with class‐weighted binary cross-entropy to counter low-kappa/rare labels  ￼.

3. Threshold Calibration
On a held-out dev set, sweep or optimize per-label thresholds (e.g. via ROC/PR-curve analysis) to maximize micro/macro F1 rather than using a fixed 0.5 cutoff  ￼.

4. Zero-/Few-Shot Prompting for Edge Cases
For labels with persistently low agreement or scant data, invoke a zero-shot classification pipeline (e.g. Facebook’s BART-MNLI via Hugging Face) with natural-language label descriptions to boost recall  ￼.








	1.	Fine-tuning a Legal-BERT model for direct classification
	2.	Zero-shot classification with GPT-4 via the OpenAI API
	3.	Embedding extraction (Sentence-Transformers) + a logistic regressor
	4.	TF-IDF feature engineering + an SVM baseline




	1.	Rule-Based / Keyword Matching
– Define label-specific keyword lists or regular-expression patterns and assign labels when matches exceed a threshold.
– (No training required; fast to implement but brittle to linguistic variation.)

	2.	Classical ML with Shallow Features
– Transform text into TF-IDF vectors and train a linear classifier such as SVM or logistic regression.  ￼
– Scales well to large corpora but struggles with long-range semantics and very large label sets.

	3.	Deep Learning (CNN / RNN)
– Embed words (e.g. with Word2Vec) and feed into a TextCNN or BiLSTM network to capture local patterns or sequential context.
– Handles non-linear patterns better than classical ML but still limited by fixed-length inputs and longer training times.

	4.	Pre-trained Transformer (BERT-Family)
– Fine-tune a general model like BERT or DistilRoBERTa on your labeled corpus (sequence-classification head).  ￼
– Captures deep contextual semantics and is easily extended to multi-label setups.

	5.	Domain-Adapted / Long-Context Transformers
– Start from a legal-domain model (e.g. LEGAL-BERT) and/or use a long-sequence variant (Longformer/BigBird) to process full opinions without truncation.  ￼ ￼
– Currently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-label legal‐classification benchmarks.

Most performant choice: A long-context, domain-adapted Transformer (e.g. LEGAL-BERT → Longformer) fine-tuned on your documents. This combines specialized legal pretraining with the ability to ingest entire filings, yielding top accuracy in recent evaluations.
