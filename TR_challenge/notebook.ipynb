App. 166, 168-69, 633 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2006) (\\u201cFailure to follow these steps carefully and in sequence may render the findings and conclusions inadequate, erroneous, or both.\\u201d), aff\\u2019d per curiam, 361 N.C. 346, 643 S.E.2d 587 (2007).\",\n",
      "        \"Husband took out a HELOC secured by the marital home during the marriage, but the trial court found that the HELOC is Husband\\u2019s separate debt based upon its findings regarding Husband\\u2019s sole control over the HELOC and his use of the funds. The trial court was unable to value the outstanding debt as of the date of separation because there was not sufficient evidence of this value. But since the HELOC was classified as a separate debt, it need not be valued and cannot be distributed. See, e.g., Smith v. Smith, 111 N.C. App. 460, 509-10, 433 S.E.2d 196, 226 (1993) (citations omitted) (\\u201cIn determining an equitable distribution, the trial court must consider the debts of the parties. If the debt is a separate debt of one of the parties, then the court must consider it pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(1). If the debt is a marital debt, that is, a debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties, then it must be valued and distributed.\\u201d (Citations and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009), rev\\u2019d in part on other grounds, 336 N.C. 575, 444 S.E.2d 420 (1994). Classification of property and debt comes first, and only marital property or debt is subject to the next two steps of valuation and distribution. See, e.g., Wall v. Wall, 140 N.C. App. 303, 307-08, 536 S.E.2d 647, 650 (2000) (\\u201cWe continue to stress the importance of following the steps of first classifying, then valuing and distributing marital property. Each step is a prerequisite to the performance of the next, and failure to follow the prescribed order will result in a fatally flawed trial court disposition. Only those assets and debts that are classified as marital property and valued are subject to distribution under the Equitable Distribution Act[.]\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009).\",\n",
      "        \"In this case, the trial court found there was not \\u201csufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K\\u201d as of the date of separation. Husband agrees with this finding, since it would be to his benefit, except that the trial court also used the 401K as a factor justifying the unequal distribution. Wife agrees the trial court did not have sufficient evidence to value the 401K, but she argues that it need not be valued to be a distributional factor. She is correct that the trial court need not value items used as distributional factors. See Gum v. Gum, 107 N.C. App. 734, 739, 421 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1992) (\\u201cThe trial court is required to consider evidence of such contributions as a distributional factor according to N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250\\u201320(c)(8). There is no language within \\u00a7 [50-20(c)\\u2009] which would indicate that the trial court is required to place a monetary value on any distributional factor and we decline to impose such an unnecessary burden upon the trial court.\\u201d). But marital property must be valued, see, e.g., Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 324, 707 S.E.2d at 790 (\\u201cIt is not enough that evidence can be found within the record which could support such classification; the court must actually classify all of the property and make a finding as to the value of all marital property.\\u201d), and the trial court found that 401K plan was marital property but did not value it. If the 401K is not marital property, the trial court could have used it as a distributional factor without valuing it; but if it is marital property, it must first be valued as part of the marital estate. See generally Gum, 107 N.C. App. at 739, 421 S.E.2d at 791; Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 324, 707 S.E.2d at 790. There is no way to know if the distribution of the marital estate is equal or unequal if there is no finding on the net value of the entire marital estate.\",\n",
      "        \"The trial court determines the credibility and weight of the evidence, see, e.g., Brackney v. Brackney, 199 N.C. App. 375, 390, 682 S.E.2d 401, 410 (2009) (\\u201c[I]t is well-established \\u2024 that when the trial court is the trier of fact, the court is empowered to assign weight to the evidence presented at the trial as it deems appropriate.\\u201d (Citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)\\u2009), and it is possible the trial court did not believe Husband\\u2019s evidence regarding the value of the 401K. But we are concerned that the trial court\\u2019s finding might be based upon the erroneous date of separation in the order. There was evidence, in the form of a letter from the 401K plan administrator, MassMutual Retirement Services Division, of the vested balance of the 401K as of 31 October 2009, the month of the parties\\u2019 separation. Yet the trial court found the parties separated in October 2007. The trial court would be correct there was no evidence of the value of the 401K in 2007\\u2014but that is not the relevant year because the parties did not separate until 2009. Wife contends the finding of the year 2007 is merely a non-prejudicial clerical error. But considering the trial court\\u2019s finding of a lack of evidence of the value of the 401K as of the date of separation, along with the evidence of a letter from the 401K plan administrator valuing the plan as of the date of separation, we cannot say for sure the date error is nonprejudicial. Again, it is possible the trial court did not rely upon the 401K plan administrator\\u2019s letter for some other reason, and that would be within the trial court\\u2019s discretion, but since we are vacating this order for other reasons, on remand, the trial court should clarify its findings regarding the valuation of the 401K as of the date of separation or its inability to value the plan.\"\n",

First, neither of these marital assets was valued, as discussed above. The second problem is either a serious clerical error or a misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \\u201cliquid.\\u201d Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a liquid asset as \\u201c[a]n asset that is readily convertible to cash, such as a marketable security, a note, or an account receivable.\\u201d Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In comparison, an illiquid asset is defined as \\u201c[a]n asset that is not readily convertible into cash, usu. because of (1) the lack of demand, (2) the absence of an established market, or (3) the substantial cost or time required for liquidation (such as real property, even when it is desirable).\\u201d Illiquid asset, Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (emphasis added). A 401K plan is not liquid since it is not readily accessible and any withdrawals prior to retirement incur substantial taxes and penalties. Equity in a home is not liquid because the home must be sold to get access to the equity. See e.g., Robertson v. Robertson, 167 N.C. App. 567, 571, 605 S.E.2d 667, 669-70 (2004) (\\u201cAlthough the trial court found defendant could liquidate the above assets to pay the $52,100.07 distributive award, the only liquid assets readily available to pay the award were two bank accounts totaling $5,929.38. Wife\\u2019s other assets included stock in PSI valued at $37,336.00, the unencumbered one-half acre lot valued at $8,920.00, and the personal property valued at $13,829.68. With the exception of the pension plan, which the trial court found would be difficult to liquidate and might cause unfavorable tax consequences, the trial court failed to make findings concerning the difficulty and possible financial and tax consequences of borrowing money against or liquidating the PSI stock, the one-half acre lot, and the personal property in order to pay the amount of the judgment lien within ninety days. Accordingly, although Wife may in fact be able to pay the distributive award, her evidence is sufficient to raise the question of whether adjusting the award from her to Husband is necessary to offset any adverse financial consequences of using the non-liquid assets.\\u201d (Citations, quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted)\\u2009).\",\n",
      "        \"As discussed above on valuation, the remainder of the finding on factor (i) is also erroneous because the marital property was not valued. The trial court found it could not value the marital equity in the home or the 401K plan. It found there was \\u201cno sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband]\\u2019s 401K\\u201d and that the exact amount of principal remaining on the HELOC and the equity in the marital residence were also unknown. Without valuation of the marital assets, it is impossible to say if a distribution is equal or unequal. See generally Crowder v. Crowder, 147 N.C.
