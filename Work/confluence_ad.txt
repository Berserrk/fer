🕵️ Article Detective – Application Documentation

⸻

📖 Purpose

Article Detective is a document intelligence platform designed to extract, analyze, and flag criminal associations in investigative and journalistic content. It provides a structured, interactive environment for researchers, analysts, and compliance teams to uncover insights hidden in unstructured text.

⸻

🎯 Use Cases
	•	Investigative journalism support: Discover links between entities across multiple articles.
	•	Compliance & due diligence: Pre-screen names against a historical entity and crime pattern database.
	•	Internal investigations: Map internal or external actors linked to misconduct.
	•	Document-driven intelligence gathering: Quickly surface and synthesize information from longform content.
