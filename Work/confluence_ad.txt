🕵️ Article Detective – Application Documentation

⸻

📖 Purpose

Article Detective was born out of a direct request from our Compliance Officers, who each year review hundreds of investigative and journalistic articles for potential risk exposure. Manually scanning such volumes is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

Article Detective streamlines this workflow by automatically:
	•	Extracting and standardizing names of people and organizations
	•	Flagging those with possible criminal associations against our historical entity database
	•	Visualizing connections and patterns across documents

By providing analysts and compliance teams with instant, data-driven insights, Article Detective significantly reduces review time, boosts accuracy in identifying high-risk entities, and ensures no critical link goes unnoticed.
⸻

🎯 Use Cases
	•	Investigative journalism support: Discover links between entities across multiple articles.
	•	Compliance & due diligence: Pre-screen names against a historical entity and crime pattern database.
	•	Internal investigations: Map internal or external actors linked to misconduct.
	•	Document-driven intelligence gathering: Quickly surface and synthesize information from longform content.

🧩 Feature Set (Detailed)

📥 Document Upload & Pipeline Execution
	•	Multi-upload drag-and-drop interface
	•	File validation (format, size, encoding)

📄 Article Summarization (Layered)

📰 Article Summarization

Each time you upload documents, Article Detective generates concise, actionable summaries:
	•	Single Document Upload
When you upload one article, the system returns a one-paragraph summary of that document.
	•	Multiple Document Uploads
When you upload multiple articles, the system will:
	1.	Produce a one-paragraph summary for each article (so each document gets its own standalone paragraph).
	2.	Automatically generate a composite summary at the end, which synthesizes the individual summaries and highlights:
	•	Shared entities across articles
	•	Recurring themes or patterns
	•	Important connections and red flags that emerge only when viewing the articles as a group

⚡ Example Workflow
	1.	Upload report1.docx, investigation2.docx, and profile3.docx.
	2.	Receive three separate paragraphs—one per file—detailing each article’s key points.
	3.	Read the final “Group Overview” paragraph, which draws links between those articles (e.g., “All three pieces reference Company X’s offshore transactions and highlight individual Y’s repeated involvement…”).

🧾 Entity Flagging Dashboard

A feature-rich interface to review system-detected entities.

The Entity Flagging Dashboard is a central, interactive HTML table that displays all entities identified and flagged by the LLM and our custom algorithms. It empowers analysts to review, correct, and enrich entity data in real time, creating a continuous feedback loop that improves model accuracy.

Feature
Description
Real-time Editing
Inline edits save immediately to the database—no page reload required.
Add/Remove Entities
• Add new entities not detected by the system• Remove false positives or obsolete entries
Modify Crime Flags
• Add or remove one or more crime tags per entity (e.g., toggle between CRIME A and CRIME B)• Support for multiple flags per row
Update Any Column
• Edit entity descriptions, comments, and confidence scores• Change categorization (first-degree vs. second-degree)
Filtering & Sorting
• Filter by crime type, flag status, or confidence level• Sort alphabetically, by frequency, or by date first flagged
Bulk Actions
• Select multiple rows to apply the same update (e.g., flag all selected entities for a new crime)

👤 User Interaction Flow
	1.	Review Flags
Entities automatically flagged by the LLM appear in the table with their detected crimes and summary.
	2.	Correct & Enrich
	•	Click on a cell to edit text (description, comments).
	•	Use the crime-tag dropdown to add/remove flags.
	•	Click the “+” icon to insert a completely new entity row.
	•	Use the trash icon to delete an incorrect entity.
	3.	Save & Sync
All changes persist instantly to the central SQL database via our DbE ORM layer.
	4.	Feedback Loop
Each user modification (new entity, changed flag, edited description) is logged and fed back into the training pipeline to refine both the LLM prompts and the rule-based components.

Tip:
Use the filter bar at the top of the table to narrow down entities by specific crimes or confidence levels before applying bulk updates.

🌐 Entity Graph View

The Entity Relationships Graph provides a visual network focused on flagged entities and their direct and indirect connections—helping analysts uncover hidden links and patterns across articles.

eature
Description
Flagged-Centric View
Automatically highlights entities flagged by the LLM in red, then dynamically loads their first- and second-degree neighbors in orange and yellow, respectively.
Relationship Types
Edge labels display one of our predefined categories (e.g., owner, investor, partner, shareholder, representative, beneficiary, other).
Dynamic Expansion
Click on any node to expand its neighbors on the fly, revealing connections not explicitly mentioned in the article corpus.
Interactive Controls

⚡ Developer & Model-Training Benefits
	•	Human-Labelled Data: Analyst inputs serve as high-quality labels for supervised retraining of LLM prompts and rule-based components.
	•	Error Correction: Rapid correction of false positives/negatives directly informs threshold adjustments and entity-resolution logic.
	•	Audit Trail: All manual edits include timestamps and user IDs, ensuring clear traceability for compliance reviews.

⸻

🔜 Upcoming Enhancements
	•	Input Templates: Pre-defined templates for common entity types (e.g., “Shell Company,” “Politically Exposed Person”) to standardize entries.
	•	Bulk Upload: CSV import for adding or updating multiple entities in one action.
	•	In-Context Suggestions: Auto-complete suggestions for entity names and crime flags based on the existing database.

⸻

⸻
Article Detective’s backend is orchestrated by a Streamlit application that sequentially triggers a suite of Python scripts. Each script performs a distinct analytical step, feeding its output into the next, to transform raw documents into a rich graph of flagged entities.






⸻

1. Document Analysis & Entity Expansion
	•	Purpose: Parse the uploaded .docx (and soon .pdf) to extract raw text segments.
	•	Process:
	•	Use NLP tokenization to split text into logical “chunks.”
	•	Generate candidate entity strings via custom heuristics.
	•	Glider module performs entity expansion—growing each seed string into variant forms (e.g., abbreviations, acronyms).

⸻

2. Entity Resolution
	•	Purpose: Consolidate multiple mentions of the same real-world entity.
	•	Process:
	•	Compute Jaccard similarity on token sets and cosine similarity on embedding vectors.
	•	Group strings into clusters when similarity exceeds configurable thresholds.
	•	Assign a canonical name to each cluster for downstream processing.

⸻

3. Entity Exclusion
	•	Purpose: Remove non-informative or overly generic terms that could muddy analysis.
	•	Process:
	•	Filter out terms matching a curated stop-list (e.g., “manager,” “director,” “team lead”).
	•	Drop entities with high document-frequency across all uploads (heuristic for generic roles).

⸻

4. Entity Categorization
	•	Purpose: Classify each resolved entity by the type of criminal activity it may be associated with.
	•	Process:
	•	Send entity descriptions to the LLM, along with a predefined list of crime categories supplied by the business.
	•	The model returns one or more flags (e.g., “Money Laundering,” “Embezzlement”).
	•	Store both the category and a confidence score for later filtering.

⸻

5. Relationship Building
	•	Purpose: Discover direct links between flagged entities based on co-occurrence and contextual cues.
	•	Process:
	•	Analyze proximity within text (same paragraph/sentence).
	•	Apply rule-based pattern matching (e.g., “X is a subsidiary of Y”).
	•	Generate a set of (Entity A) — [Relationship Type] —> (Entity B) triples.

⸻

6. Second-Degree Flagging
	•	Purpose: Identify entities indirectly connected to criminal actors (“friends of flagged”).
	•	Process:
	•	For each flagged entity, query the LLM for known associates or partners that may also warrant attention.
	•	Validate suggestions against the historical entity database to avoid spurious flags.
	•	Mark these as second-degree in the graph view.

⸻

🔄 Continuous Feedback Loop:
All user edits in the Flagging Dashboard feed back into retraining both the LLM prompts and rule-based thresholds, refining every step of this pipeline over time.
