🕵️ Article Detective – Application Documentation

⸻

📖 Purpose

Article Detective was born out of a direct request from our Compliance Officers, who each year review hundreds of investigative and journalistic articles for potential risk exposure. Manually scanning such volumes is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

Article Detective streamlines this workflow by automatically:
	•	Extracting and standardizing names of people and organizations
	•	Flagging those with possible criminal associations against our historical entity database
	•	Visualizing connections and patterns across documents

By providing analysts and compliance teams with instant, data-driven insights, Article Detective significantly reduces review time, boosts accuracy in identifying high-risk entities, and ensures no critical link goes unnoticed.
⸻

🎯 Use Cases
	•	Investigative journalism support: Discover links between entities across multiple articles.
	•	Compliance & due diligence: Pre-screen names against a historical entity and crime pattern database.
	•	Internal investigations: Map internal or external actors linked to misconduct.
	•	Document-driven intelligence gathering: Quickly surface and synthesize information from longform content.

	RiskLab Platform
	•	A proprietary bank-internal wrapper around Azure
	•	Manages clusters (workspaces) that allocate compute and storage resources
	•	Persists uploaded files and intermediate data in Azure Blob Storage
	•	(Resource consumption details are documented on the RiskLab Resource Usage page)
	•	Article Detective App
	•	Streamlit front end for user interaction and dashboarding
	•	Python processing scripts triggered from the UI for NLP pipelines
	•	Embedded HTML tables in Streamlit for the Activities Dashboard
	•	Data-Base Engine/ Object relational mapping layer for all database reads/writes to a central SQL database

This separation ensures that Article Detective can focus on analysis and visualization, while RiskLab provides a scalable, secure Azure-backed infrastructure.

🧩 Feature Set (Detailed)

📥 Document Upload & Pipeline Execution
	•	Multi-upload drag-and-drop interface
	•	File validation (format, size, encoding)
	•	Upload queue monitoring
	•	Reprocessing check to avoid duplication

🔐 All uploads are encrypted at rest and in transit.

📄 Article Summarization (Layered)

📰 Article Summarization

Each time you upload documents, Article Detective generates concise, actionable summaries:
	•	Single Document Upload
When you upload one article, the system returns a one-paragraph summary of that document.
	•	Multiple Document Uploads
When you upload multiple articles, the system will:
	1.	Produce a one-paragraph summary for each article (so each document gets its own standalone paragraph).
	2.	Automatically generate a composite summary at the end, which synthesizes the individual summaries and highlights:
	•	Shared entities across articles
	•	Recurring themes or patterns
	•	Important connections and red flags that emerge only when viewing the articles as a group

⚡ Example Workflow
	1.	Upload report1.docx, investigation2.docx, and profile3.docx.
	2.	Receive three separate paragraphs—one per file—detailing each article’s key points.
	3.	Read the final “Group Overview” paragraph, which draws links between those articles (e.g., “All three pieces reference Company X’s offshore transactions and highlight individual Y’s repeated involvement…”).

🧾 Entity Flagging Dashboard

A feature-rich interface to review system-detected entities.

The Entity Flagging Dashboard is a central, interactive HTML table that displays all entities identified and flagged by the LLM and our custom algorithms. It empowers analysts to review, correct, and enrich entity data in real time, creating a continuous feedback loop that improves model accuracy.

Feature
Description
Real-time Editing
Inline edits save immediately to the database—no page reload required.
Add/Remove Entities
• Add new entities not detected by the system• Remove false positives or obsolete entries
Modify Crime Flags
• Add or remove one or more crime tags per entity (e.g., toggle between CRIME A and CRIME B)• Support for multiple flags per row
Update Any Column
• Edit entity descriptions, comments, and confidence scores• Change categorization (first-degree vs. second-degree)
Filtering & Sorting
• Filter by crime type, flag status, or confidence level• Sort alphabetically, by frequency, or by date first flagged
Bulk Actions
• Select multiple rows to apply the same update (e.g., flag all selected entities for a new crime)

👤 User Interaction Flow
	1.	Review Flags
Entities automatically flagged by the LLM appear in the table with their detected crimes and summary.
	2.	Correct & Enrich
	•	Click on a cell to edit text (description, comments).
	•	Use the crime-tag dropdown to add/remove flags.
	•	Click the “+” icon to insert a completely new entity row.
	•	Use the trash icon to delete an incorrect entity.
	3.	Save & Sync
All changes persist instantly to the central SQL database via our DbE ORM layer.
	4.	Feedback Loop
Each user modification (new entity, changed flag, edited description) is logged and fed back into the training pipeline to refine both the LLM prompts and the rule-based components.

Tip:
Use the filter bar at the top of the table to narrow down entities by specific crimes or confidence levels before applying bulk updates.

🌐 Entity Graph View

The Entity Relationships Graph provides a visual network focused on flagged entities and their direct and indirect connections—helping analysts uncover hidden links and patterns across articles.

eature
Description
Flagged-Centric View
Automatically highlights entities flagged by the LLM in red, then dynamically loads their first- and second-degree neighbors in orange and yellow, respectively.
Relationship Types
Edge labels display one of our predefined categories (e.g., owner, investor, partner, shareholder, representative, beneficiary, other).
Dynamic Expansion
Click on any node to expand its neighbors on the fly, revealing connections not explicitly mentioned in the article corpus.
Interactive Controls
• Zoom & Pan: Mouse or touch gestures for seamless navigation• Full-Screen Mode: Focus on complex networks without UI distractions
Detail-On-Demand
Selecting a node opens a side-panel with:


	•	Entity summary and description
	•	List of associated crimes and flags
	•	Links to all source articles where the entity appears                                                               |
| Filtering & Highlighting    | • Filter by relationship type or confidence score• Highlight Paths between two selected entities to trace potential indirect links
